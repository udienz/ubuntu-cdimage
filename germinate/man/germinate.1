.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to help with the maintenance of large software distributions.
It takes a list of seed packages and a mirror of the distribution, and
produces outputs with the seed packages and their dependencies and
build-dependencies expanded out in full.
.Ss Seeds
The contents of the Ubuntu distribution, and others, are managed by means of
.Em seeds .
At their simplest, these are lists of packages which are considered
important to have in the main component of the distribution, without
explicitly listing all their dependencies and build-dependencies.
.Pp
Seed lists are typically divided up by category: a
.Li base
or
.Li minimal
seed might list the core set of packages required to make the system run at
all, while a
.Li desktop
seed might list the set of packages installed as part of a default desktop
installation.
.Nm
takes these seeds, adds their dependency trees, and produces an
.Em output
for each seed which contains a dependency-expanded list of package names.
These outputs may be handed on to archive maintenance or CD-building tools.
.Pp
Some seeds may
.Em inherit
from other seeds: they rely on those seeds to be installed.
For example, a
.Li desktop
seed will typically inherit from a
.Li minimal
seed.
.Nm
understands these inheritance relationships.
If a package in the
.Li desktop
seed depends on
.Sq foo ,
but
.Sq foo
is already part of the
.Li minimal
seed or dependency list, then
.Sq foo
will not be added to the
.Li desktop
output.
.Pp
Seeds are stored in text files downloaded from a given URL.
Lines not beginning with
.Sq "\ *\ "
(wiki-style list markup) are ignored.
.Pp
Seed entries may simply consist of a package name, or may include any of the
following special syntax:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It %
Seed entries beginning with
.Sq %
expand to all binaries from the given source package.
.It [...]
Seed entries may be followed with
.Sq " [" Ns Ar arch1 Ar arch2 ... Ns \&]
to indicate that they should only be used on the given architectures, or with
.Sq " [!" Ns Ar arch1 No ! Ns Ar arch2 ... Ns \&]
to indicate that they should not be used on the given architectures.
.It (...)
Seed entries in parentheses indicate that the seed should be treated as a
recommendation of metapackages generated from this seed, rather than as a
dependency.
.It !
Seed entries beginning with
.Sq \&!
cause the given package to be blacklisted from the given seed and any seeds
from which it inherits; this may be followed by
.Sq %
as above to blacklist all binaries from the given source package.
Note that this may result in uninstallable packages whose dependencies have
been blacklisted, so use this feature sparingly.
The purpose of a blacklist is to make it obvious when a package that is not
supposed to be installed ends up in
.Nm Ns 's
output, so that package relationships can be fixed to stop that happening.
It is not intended for the purpose of working around buggy package
relationships, and attempts to do so will not work because
.Ic apt
has no way to know about blacklist entries in seeds.
.It key: value
Some seeds also contain headers at the top of the file, in
.Dq key: value
format.
For the most part, these are not parsed by
.Nm
itself.
The Ubuntu
.Ic tasksel
package uses keys beginning with
.Sq Task\-
to define fields of similar names in its
.Pa .desc
files.
.Xr germinate\-update\-metapackage 1
uses some of these headers to reduce the need for fragile configuration;
see its documentation for further details.
.El
.Pp
A
.Pa STRUCTURE
file alongside the seeds lists their inheritance relationships.
It may also include lines beginning with
.Sq include ,
causing other collections of seeds to be included as if they were part of
the collection currently being germinated, or lines beginning with
.Sq feature ,
which set flags for the processing of seeds.
The only flag currently defined is
.Sq follow\-recommends ,
which causes
.Nm
to treat Recommends fields as if they were Depends.
(Features may also be set on a per-seed basis using lines beginning with
.Sq "\ *\ Feature:"
in the seed file; here,
.Sq no\-follow\-recommends
is also supported to allow Recommends-following to be turned off for
individual seeds.)
.Ss Build-dependencies and Sq supported
There is typically no need for a default desktop installation to contain all
the compilers and development libraries needed to build itself from source;
if nothing else, it would consume much more space.
Nevertheless, it is normally a requirement for the maintainers of a
distribution to support all the packages necessary to build that
distribution.
.Pp
.Nm
therefore does not add all the packages that result from following
build-dependencies of seed packages and of their dependencies (the
.Dq build-dependency tree )
to every output, unless they are also in the seed or in the dependency list.
Instead, it adds them to the output for the last seed in the
.Pa STRUCTURE
file, conventionally called
.Li supported .
.Pp
Like any other seed, the supported seed may contain its own list of
packages.
It is common to provide support for many software packages which are not in
the default installation, such as debugging libraries, optimised kernels,
alternative language support, and the like.
.Ss Outputs
The output files are named after the seed to which they correspond.
An additional output file is needed for supported, namely
.Sq supported+build\-depends ,
which contains the supported list and the build-depends lists of the other
seeds all joined together.
An
.Sq all
output is produced to represent the entire archive.
.Pp
Some other files are produced for occasional use by experts.
See the
.Pa README
file for full details on these.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Xo Fl v ,
.Fl Fl verbose
.Xc
Be more verbose when processing seeds.
.It Xo Fl S ,
.Fl Fl seed\-source Ar source Ns \&,...
.Xc
Fetch seeds from the specified sources.
The default is
.Pa http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/seeds/ ,
or
.Pa http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/
if the
.Fl Fl bzr
option is used.
You may use
.Pa file://
URLs here to fetch seeds from the local file system; for example, if your
seeds are stored in
.Pa /home/username/seeds/debian.unstable ,
then you would use the options
.Fl S Ar file:///home/username/seeds/
.Fl s Ar debian.unstable .
.It Xo Fl s ,
.Fl Fl seed\-dist Ar dist
.Xc
Fetch seeds for distribution
.Ar dist .
The default is
.Li ubuntu.oneiric .
.It Xo Fl m ,
.Fl Fl mirror Ar mirror
.Xc
Get package lists from
.Ar mirror .
The default is
.Pa http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ .
May be supplied multiple times; the newest version of each package across
all archives will win.
.It Fl Fl source\-mirror Ar mirror
Get source package lists from
.Ar mirror .
The default is to use package lists mirrors.
May be supplied multiple times; the newest version of each source package
across all archives will win.
.It Xo Fl d ,
.Fl Fl dist Ar dist Ns \&,...
.Xc
Operate on the specified distributions.
The default is
.Li oneiric .
Listing multiple distributions may be useful, for example, when examining
both a released distribution and its security updates.
.It Xo Fl a ,
.Fl Fl arch Ar arch
.Xc
Operate on architecture
.Ar arch .
The default is
.Li i386 .
.It Xo Fl c ,
.Fl Fl components Ar component Ns \&,...
.Xc
Operate on the specified components.
The default is
.Li main .
.It Fl Fl bzr
Check out seeds from the
.Ic bzr
branch found at
.Ar seed\-source Ns / Ns Ar seed\-dist
rather than fetching them directly from a URL.
Requires
.Ic bzr
to be installed.
.It Fl Fl no\-rdepends
Disable reverse-dependency calculations.
These calculations cause a large number of small files to be written out in
the
.Pa rdepends/
directory, and may take some time.
.It Fl Fl no\-installer
Do not consider debian-installer udeb packages.
While generally not the desired outcome, sometimes you might wish to omit consideration of installer packages when processing your seeds, perhaps if sending the output directly to the package manager on an already-installed system.
.It Fl Fl seed\-packages Ar parent Ns / Ns Ar pkg Ns \&,...
Treat each
.Ar pkg
as a seed by itself, inheriting from
.Ar parent
(i.e. assuming that all packages in the
.Ar parent
seed are already installed while calculating the additional dependencies of
.Ar pkg ) .
This allows the use of
.Nm
to calculate the dependencies of individual extra packages.
For example,
.Fl Fl seed\-packages Ar desktop Ns / Ns Ar epiphany\-browser
will create an
.Pa epiphany\-browser
output file listing the additional packages that need to be installed over
and above the
.Ar desktop
seed in order to install
.Ar epiphany\-browser .
.El
.Sh BUGS
The wiki-style markup in seeds was inherited from an early implementation,
and is a wart.
.Pp
.Nm
can sometimes be confused by complicated situations involving the order in
which it encounters dependencies on virtual packages.
Explicit entries in seeds may be required to work around this.
.Pp
Handling of installer packages (udebs) is complicated, poorly documented,
and doesn't always work quite right: in particular, packages aren't demoted
to the supported seed when they should be.
