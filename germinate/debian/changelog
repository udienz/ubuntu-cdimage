  * Document fetching seeds from the local file system (closes: #363536).
  * Add an example of using --seed-packages.
  * Change default distribution to intrepid. Update kubuntu-meta example in

    entries in update.cfg.
  * Fix error message on failing to download non-bzr seeds.
  * Update kubuntu-meta example in germinate-update-metapackage(1).
  * Simplify germinate-update-metapackage changelog output when a package

  * Plant seeds in topologically-sorted order. The intent of this change is
    the same as that in 0.40, only this time it should actually work in the
    face of seeds that inherit from other seeds that are overridden in a
    different branch.
  * On the other hand, continue to use the last entry in the source
    STRUCTURE file as the supported seed. It may not be topologically last
    if there are seeds in included branches that are not inherited by
    supported.
  * Remove overridden entries from 'structure' output file.

germinate (0.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix germination from multiple seed sources in bzr mode.
  * germinate-update-metapackage now automatically expands the seeds option
    for seed inheritance, so you no longer usually need to have separate
    seeds and output_seeds options in update.cfg.

    germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add -S/--seed-source, -s/--seed-dist, and -d/--dist options to
    germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add support for germinating from multiple seed sources as well as
    multiple branches. This is needed to support "third-party" seed branches
    that are stored in a different location from branches they include.
  * Fix rescuing of packages from extra, broken in 0.32.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jan 2008 21:53:30 +0000

germinate (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make germinate-update-metapackage only blacklist the metapackage being
    generated, not all metapackages. See LP #148075.
  * Change default distribution to hardy.
  * Vcs-Bzr is now an official field.
  * Fix 'structure' output file; records were being separated by the empty
    string rather than by newlines, which made it rather useless.
  * Add an 'include' facility to the STRUCTURE file to allow seeds from one
    branch to inherit from seeds in another branch.
  * Automatically compute the transitive closure of inheritance
    relationships in the STRUCTURE file, rather than requiring them to be
    written out by hand. In other words, if you have 'minimal: required'
    then you can simply write 'standard: minimal' rather than 'standard:
    required minimal'. This is a requirement for sane use of 'include',
    since it may not be straightforward to hardcode the inheritance
    relationships among seeds in another branch.
  * Unhardcode the 'supported' seed. The last seed in the STRUCTURE file is
    now used for build-depends calculations.
  * Policy version 3.7.3: no changes required.

  * Use dch -iU rather than dch -U. (I use
    DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC=changelog so never noticed the problem.)
  * Fix germinate-pkg-diff --mode option (was incorrectly --mirror, contrary
    to its meaning and the documentation).
  * Make germinate-pkg-diff work again even if supported is not in its list
    of seeds.
  * germinate-pkg-diff now automatically adds inherited seeds as necessary.
    Thus, the default list of seeds is reduced to simply 'desktop'.
  * Download package index files to a temporary directory if they aren't
    going to be saved.
  * Clean up package index files downloaded for germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add germinate-pkg-diff -a/--arch option.
  * Update copyright dates.

  * Honour blacklist entries even if they're explicitly seeded.
  * Don't apply blacklists (apart from the "supported" blacklist) to
    build-dependencies.
  * Be a little more verbose when blacklisting packages.
  * Allow "seed_map/SEED" configuration file entries in update-metapackage
    to have an output metapackage read its package list from multiple seeds
    (needed for splitting required and minimal in the Ubuntu seeds).

germinate (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for negative architecture specifications, e.g. [!powerpc].
  * Document % and [arch] seed syntaxes in germinate(1).
  * Add support for prefixing seed entries with "!" to enforce blacklisting
    packages from the containing seed and any of its inner seeds. For
    example, this allows a package to be in Ubuntu main but blacklisted from
    being shipped on CDs.

    This avoids slews of warnings for binaries that only exist on other

  * Consider sources from inner seeds while rescuing packages from extra (so
    e.g. in Ubuntu Extra-Include in supported should look at source packages
    from minimal etc. as well as from supported).
  * Rescue from sources in the build tree in a separate pass, and add
    rescued packages to the depends/build-depends lists rather than
    pretending that they're explicitly seeded. This means that rescued

    depending on whether their source packages were found while processing

  * Add support for Extra-Include and Extra-Exclude variables, which allow

    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/seed-cleanup).
  * Tweak logging priorities for messages about virtual seed entries.
  * Don't display debugging messages by default; add germinate -v/--verbose
    option to display them.
  * Use sets rather than lists where possible. This roughly halves the
    runtime for the Ubuntu seeds.
  * Add extras recursively: binaries generated by sources pulled in by
    dependencies or build-dependencies of extra binaries should themselves
    be extra.

germinate (0.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * When processing the build tree, germinate is (correctly) careful not to
    promote packages from lesser seeds, since we still want to consider them
    (e.g.) part of ship even if they're build-dependencies of desktop.
    However, this sometimes caused us to select the wrong alternative from
    an or-ed build-dependency (e.g. redland Build-Depends:
    libmysqlclient15-dev | libmysqlclient12-dev | libmysqlclient10-dev and
    libmysqlclient15-dev was in the Ubuntu supported seed). To fix this,
    process the packages at that point anyway and just avoid promoting them.

germinate (0.8) dapper; urgency=low

  * When identifying extras, check for binaries built from multiple source
    packages and skip any superseded binaries.
  * Change default for --components to main and restricted, since the Ubuntu
    seeds rely on packages from restricted in order to germinate correctly.

germinate (0.7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Depend on python-apt (thanks, Jani Monoses).

germinate (0.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add regular expression support in seeds. Weaken architecture
    specification error checking in order to be able to use [...] in regular
    expressions more easily.
  * Add support for including all the binaries from a given source package
    (using "%source") in seeds.
  * Add germinate --cleanup option, to prevent caching of Packages and
    Sources files.
  * Add germinate --source-mirror option, to allow Packages and Sources
    files to be on different mirrors (e.g. Ubuntu ports architectures).

germinate (0.5) dapper; urgency=high

  * Stop accidentally including extra in the all and supported+build-depends
    outputs.

germinate (0.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Don't attempt to satisfy versioned dependencies of .debs using virtual
    packages, as the packaging toolchain doesn't support that. (udpkg/anna
    do support this for .udebs, and the installer relies on that.)
  * Change default distribution to dapper.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 25 Oct 2005 12:14:07 +0100

germinate (0.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add a man page for germinate.
  * Explain in pkg-diff --help that you can supply a list of seeds to
    compare against as non-option arguments.
  * Update pkg-diff's default seeds to 'minimal standard desktop', to match
    the breezy seeds.
  * Add germinate --seed-packages option, to allow calculating dependencies
    of individual extra packages during a germinate run.
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.
  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 18:47:20 +0100

germinate (0.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix formatting of output lines with UTF-8 maintainer strings.
  * Really pick the first reason from the build-dependency tree to display
    in output files.
  * Record allowed d-i kernel versions on a per-seed basis, so that we can
    have some kernel versions supported for netboot installations only.
  * Force a trailing slash onto the end of any --seed-source argument.

germinate (0.1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
